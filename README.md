# ViolentCrime
Violent crime analysis using "Street Level Crime Data" published by the UK Home Office
This project aims to answer
What crime categories does the Police data use?
Have the same categories been used consistently?
Are levels of violent crime constant, increasing, or decreasing
Using data prior to the first lockdown predict violent crime levels for April 2020
Compare predicted crime levels with actuals, and so determine whether significant changes to violent crime occurred
The Leicester region was put in a local lockdown in July 2020. Verify your findings (if any) with respect to that region only.
